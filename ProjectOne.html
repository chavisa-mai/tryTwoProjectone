        <!-- About me -->

<div>
    <h2 id="About">About Me</h2>
    <img src="./Resource/Dechathipat_Mai_M18 copy.jpg">
    <p>My name is <span class="firstletter">Mai</span> and I'm a novice when it comes to coding. I'm never been taught about computer language, never heard of it, 
        , and never seen it. One day I was just curious how things we use everyday, ig. computer, can be something that most peopleleast understood.
        With that, I am pretty proud of my self to actually write my first ever HTML project that incoroperate with CSS (A week ago if you'd ask me what 
        an HTML or CSS is, I would say idk).
     </p>
  
</div>

<!--Goal-->

<div>
    <h2 id="Goals">Goals</h2>
        <p>Everybody has goals and ambitions. It is a human way to create meaning in life.. Here are my goals with regards to coding:
        <ol class="Center">
            <li>I want to be able to fluently code in Javascript</li>
            <li>I want to be able to talk with tech people using their jargon</li>
            <li>I want to be able to start an NFT project form scratch through coding</li>
        </ol></p>

</div>
    
<!-- TimeLine -->

<div>
    <h2 id="TimeLine">TimeLine</h2>
    <p>Have you heard of <abbr title="SMART: Specificity, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Timely">*SMART goal</abbr>? It's an 
    tool to acheive any goals. For me, when talking about timeline, I think its pretty ambiguous since I know nothing about the subject before so 
    it is hard to make a prediction of when i should complete those goals. Neverthless, I've been watching lots of YT videos of people getting a job
at Google with 6 months of training (no prior background) which motivates me to complete this goal by 1 year.</p>
</div>

<!-- HOW? -->

<div>
    <h2 id="how">The HOW?</h2>
    <p>As easy as it to say "<b>1 year</b>", it is harder to do. So I am here to say that I am commited to finish at least two 300 hours course 
    on HTML and Javascript by the end of 6 months. I think it is doable if you thing about it... </p>

</div>

<!-- table -->

<div id="table">
    <h3 class="THead">Table of Mai's timeline:</h3>
    <table style="border:1px solid black;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
        <tr>
           <th></th>
           <th></th>
               <th colspan="1" scope="col">Calculation</th>
               <th colspan="2" scope="col">Time</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">Step 1:</th>
            <td colspan="2">1 year = 365 days</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">step 2:</th>
            <td colspan="2">1hr/day: 300 days</td>
            <td>Tooo longgg</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">Step 3:</th>
            <td colspan="2">3hr/day: 100 days</td>
            <td>Better but...</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">Step 4:</th>
            <td colspan="2">5/day: 60 days!</td>
            <td>Yes yesss.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
<h3>Conclusion: I will find at least 3 hours a day to code. This means it will take me exactly 6 months to complete 2 courses :D</h3>
